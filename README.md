***Happy AR Painter*** is a [Bob Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross)-themed AR painting app that lets you use your iPhone or iPad to “paint” in 3D space using geometric shapes that can be animated. Think of it as a much less expensive version of Google’s Tilt Brush!

This app was the first of four apps that I presented for the ARKit Workshop at the [RWDevCon 2018 conference.](https://www.rwdevcon.com/) I built the app in front of the audience, who were invited to code along with me.
